### Diversification Score Function: Mathematical Breakdown

The `diversification_score` function computes a portfolio's diversification ratio using the following steps:

1. **Asset Returns**:  
   The core of portfolio analysis is based on asset returns, which are the percentage change in price over time. These returns are used to calculate the mean return (expected return) and covariance (a measure of how assets move together). Compute returns for each asset:
  
   $$r_i = \frac{P_{i,t} - P_{i,t-1}}{P_{i,t-1}}$$

   where $ P_{i,t} $ is the price of asset $Ei$ at time $t$.

2. **Mean Returns**: 

   The average return of each asset over the time period. 
   Calculate the average return for each asset:
   $$
   \mu_i = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} r_{i,t}
   $$

3. **Covariance Matrix**:  
   This matrix measures the relationship between the returns of different assets. It is crucial for assessing portfolio risk.
   Compute the covariance between asset returns:
   $$
   \Sigma = \text{Cov}(r_i, r_j)
   $$

4. **Weights**:  
   - **Equal-Weight**:  
   Equal Weighting: All assets are assigned equal importance, meaning each receives a weight of  
     $$
     w_i = \frac{1}{N},
     $$
     where $N$ is the number of assets.
   - **Inverse Volatility**: 
   Inverse Volatility Weighting: Assets with lower volatility receive higher weights. This method assigns weights inversely proportional to the volatility (standard deviation) of each asset.

     Weights are based on inverse volatility:
     $$
     w_i = \frac{1 / \sigma_i}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} 1 / \sigma_j}
     $$
   - **Market-Cap**:  
   Market Capitalization Weighting: If market capitalization data is provided, the assets are weighted according to their market capitalization, ensuring that larger companies have a bigger share in the portfolio.

     Weights are proportional to market capitalization:
     $$
     w_i = \frac{MC_i}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} MC_j}
     $$

5. **Portfolio Risk**:  
The function computes the portfolioâ€™s total risk and expected return based on the individual asset weights, returns, and the covariance matrix:

   - Risk: The total risk (volatility) of the portfolio.
   - Return: The expected return of the portfolio based on the individual asset returns
   - Portfolio volatility is calculated as:
   $$
   \sigma_p = \sqrt{w^T \Sigma w}
   $$



6. **Diversification Ratio**:  
Diversification Ratio: The diversification ratio is calculated as the weighted average of the individual asset standard deviations divided by the total portfolio risk. This ratio shows how effectively the portfolio spreads risk across assets. Finally, the diversification ratio is:
   $$
   DR = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i \sigma_i}{\sigma_p}
   $$
